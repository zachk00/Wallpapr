# Wallpapr
React Native App

You need to set up an emulator on your computer to run our project.
You also need to create a React native project. Just copy and paste our code into your App.js

Description:
Wallpapr runs in React-Native and accesses NASA's open-api to curate the "Astronomy Picture of the Day". The app separates the image, as well as its author, title, and source, and displays them on screen. The user can then press a button to set the image as their wallpaper, and voila!
